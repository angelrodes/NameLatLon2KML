# NameLatLon2KML
Plot data from a spreadsheet (Name-Latitude-Longitude columns) in Google Earth.

Angel Rodes, 2020

NameLatLon2KML is a simple and fast tool to plot in Google Earth a set of locations from a spreadsheet.

This script works in Linux. You just need to have Google Earth (or any other program that reads kml files) and xsel (for the script to read the clipboard) installed.

Just open your spreadsheet, copy the Name-Lat-Lon columns and run the script. Google Earth will magically open and show you the sites.

Site names should not contain spaces.
